# BlueStew

You want a directory structure like this:

BlueStew/
BlueStew/Input
BlueStew/Input/Input_Decks

place mtg.py, generator_setup.py, and generator.py in BlueStew, unzip blue_stew_decks.zip in Input/Input_Decks, and put everything else in BlueStew/Input

if you then run generator.py in python3 in the BlueStew directory, it should create a deck and display it, along with a bunch of other things that are only useful in the debugging process.
